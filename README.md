NearestCity
===========

Android app that displays and speaks name of the nearest city. Designed for use on highways.

I drive a lot and I like to know roughly were I am. My SatNav (GPS) application can guide me well, but gives no 
indication where I am currently. This app is a solution.

The app currently works in USA only, because the service it is using is fed with US Census data.
